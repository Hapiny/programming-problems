## Problem description

There are two sorted arrays **nums1** and **nums2** of size **m** and **n** respectively. <br>
Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)). <br>
You may assume **nums1** and **nums2** cannot be both empty.

## Example 1
nums1 = [ 1, 3 ]<br>
nums2 = [ 2 ]

The median is **2**.

## Example 2
nums1 = [ 1, 2 ]<br>
nums2 = [ 3, 4 ]

The median is **(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5**.

## Example 3
nums1 = [ 23, 26, 31, 35 ]
nums = [ 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 16 ]

The median is **(11 + 16) / 2 = 13.5**.
